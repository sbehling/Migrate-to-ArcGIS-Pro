## Requirements

You will need a laptop with a Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) with ArcGIS Pro installed.
Your instructor will use ArcGIS Pro version 2.7, but versions 2.5-2.8 will be able to use this curriculum easily with little to no modifications.

## Sessions

Most sessions will consist of a short introductory lecture followed by a demo, then some time for you to work through an exercise on your own.
